# Advanced-Disc-Scheduling-Simulator
An advanced disk scheduling simulator models how storage I/O requests are served using algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN. It visualizes head movement, analyzes performance, and compares seek times, helping users understand and optimize disk access efficiency.
